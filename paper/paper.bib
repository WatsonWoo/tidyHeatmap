              graphics are powerful for efficient visualization of patterns and
              relationships among high dimensional genomic data. Here we
              present the ComplexHeatmap package that provides rich
              functionalities for customizing heatmaps, arranging multiple
              parallel heatmaps and including user-defined annotation graphics.
              We demonstrate the power of ComplexHeatmap to easily reveal
              patterns and correlations among multiple sources of information
              with four real-world datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
              The ComplexHeatmap package and documentation are freely available
